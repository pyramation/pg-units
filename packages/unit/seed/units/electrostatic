# Electromagnetic CGS Units
# 
# For measuring electromagnetic quantities in SI, we introduce the new base
# dimension of current, define the ampere to measure current, and derive the
# other electromagnetic units from the ampere.  With the CGS units one approach
# is to use the basic equations of electromagnetism to define units that
# eliminate constants from those equations.  Coulombs law has the form
#
#          F = k_C q1 q2 / r^2
#
# where k_C is the coulomb constant equal to 1|4 pi epsilon0 in SI units.
# Ampere's force law takes the form
#
#          dF/dl = 2 k_A I1 I2 / r
#
# where k_A is the ampere constant.  In the CGS system we force either k_C or
# k_A to 1 which then defines either a unit for charge or a unit for current.
# The other unit then becomes a derived unit.  When k_C is 1 the ESU system
# results.  When k_A is 1 the EMU system results.  Note that these parameters
# are not independent of each other: Maxwell's equations indicate that
#         
#           k_C / k_A = c^2
#
# where c is the speed of light. 
#
# One more choice is needed to define a complete system.  Using Coulomb's law
# we define the electric field as the force per unit charge
#
#           E = k_C 1 / r^2.
#
# But what about the magnetic field?  It is derived from Ampere's law but we
# have the option of adding a proportionality constant, k_B, that may have
# dimensions:
#
#           B = 2 k_A k_B I / r
#
# We can choose k_B = 1, which is done in the SI, ESU and EMU systems.  But if
# instead we give k_B units of length/time then the magnetic field has
# the same units as the electric field.  This choice leads to the Gaussian
# system.
#
# The relations above are used to determine the dimensions, but the units are
# derived from the base units of CGS, not directly from those formulas.  We
# will use the notation [unit] to refer to the dimension of the unit in
# brackets.  This same process gives rise to the SI units such as the tesla, 
# which is defined by
#
#          B = 2

# Electrostatic CGS (ESU)
#
# This system uses the statcoulomb as the fundamental unit of charge, with
# derived units that parallel the conventional terminology but use the stat-
# prefix.  The statcoulomb is designed by setting k_C=1, which means
#
#                      dyne = statcoulomb^2 / cm^2. 
#
# The statcoulomb is also called the franklin or esu.
#
# The ESU system was specified by a committee report in 1873 and rarely used.

# Electromagnetic CGS (EMU)
#
# The abampere is the fundamental unit of this system, with the derived units
# using the ab- prefix.  The dimensions of the abampere are defined by assuming
# that k_A=1, which 
#
#            [dyne / cm]  = [2 abampere^2 / cm]
#
# where the brackets indicate taking the dimension of the unit in base units
# and discarding any constant factors.  This results in the definition from
# base CGS units of:
#
#            abampere = sqrt(dyne). 
#
# The abampere is also called the biot.  The magnetic field unit (the gauss)
# follows from the assumption that k_B=1, which means
#
#            B = 2 I / r,
#
# and hence the dimensions of the gauss are given by
#
#            [gauss] = [2 abampere / cm]
#
# or rewriting in terms of the base units
#
#            gauss = abampere / cm.
#
# The definition given below is different because it is in a form that
# gives a valid reduction for SI and ESU and still gives the correct 
# result in EMU.  (It can be derived from Faraday's law.)  
#
# The EMU system was developed by Gauss and Weber and formalized as a system in
# a committee report by the British Association for the Advancement of Science
# in 1873.

# Electromagnetic CGS (Gaussian)
#
# The Gaussian system uses the statcoulomb and statamp from the ESU system
# derived by setting k_C=1, but it defines the magnetic field unit differently
# by taking k_B=c instead of k_B=1.  As noted above, k_C and k_A are not
# independent.  With k_C=1 we must have k_A=c^-2.  This results in the magnetic
# field unit, the gauss, having dimensions give by:
#
#         [gauss] = [2 (c^-2) c statamp / cm] = [statamp / c cm]
#
# We then define the gauss using base CGS units to obtain
#
#         gauss = statamp / ((cm/s) cm) = statcoulomb / cm^2.
#
# Note that this definition happens to give the same result as the definition
# for the EMU system, so the definitions of the gauss are consistent.
#
# This definition gives the same dimensions for the E and B fields and was also
# known as the "symmetric system".  This system was proposed by Hertz in 1888.
