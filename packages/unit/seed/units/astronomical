# Astronomical time measurements
#
# Astronomical time measurement is a complicated matter.  The length of the
# true day at a given place can be 21 seconds less than 24 hours or 30 seconds
# over 24 hours.  The two main reasons for this are the varying speed of the
# earth in its elliptical orbit and the fact that the sun moves on the ecliptic
# instead of along the celestial equator.  To devise a workable system for time
# measurement, Simon Newcomb (1835-1909) used a fictitious "mean sun".
# Consider a first fictitious sun traveling along the ecliptic at a constant
# speed and coinciding with the true sun at perigee and apogee.  Then
# considering a second fictitious sun traveling along the celestial equator at
# a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious sun at the
# equinoxes.  The second fictitious sun is the "mean sun".  From this equations
# can be written out to determine the length of the mean day, and the tropical
# year.  The length of the second was determined based on the tropical year
# from such a calculation and was officially used from 1960-1967 until atomic
# clocks replaced astronomical measurements for a standard of time.  All of the
# values below give the mean time for the specified interval.
#
# See "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" by Jean Meeus for more details
# and a description of how to compute the correction to mean time.

# Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units
# using the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units.  The
# uncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units
# significantly less accurate.

# The astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor
# axis of a massless object with the same year as the earth.  With such a
# definition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's
# third law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.

# Kepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital
# period, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant
# and M is the mass.  With M = 1 and T and a chosen for the earth's orbit, we
# find sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3).  This constant is called the Gaussian
# gravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did the
# calculations.  However, when the original calculation was done, the value
# for the length of the earth's year was inaccurate.  The value used is called
# the Gaussian year.  Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into
# agreement with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a
# lot of previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal
# to this original value.  This is accomplished by using a standard value for
# the Gaussian gravitational constant.  This constant is called k.

# Parallax is the angular difference between the topocentric (on Earth's
# surface) and geocentric (at Earth's center) direction toward a celestial body
# when the body is at a given altitude.  When the body is on the horizon, the
# parallax is the horizontal parallax; when the body is on the horizon and the
# observer is on the equator, the parallax is the equatorial horizontal
# parallax.  When the body is at zenith, the parallax is zero.

# Light from celestial objects is attenuated by passage through Earth's
# atmosphere.  A body near the horizon passes through much more air than an
# object at zenith, and is consequently less bright.  Air mass is the ratio of
# the length of the optical path at a given altitude (angle above the horizon)
# to the length at zenith.  Air mass at zenith is by definition unity; at the
# horizon, air mass is approximately 38, though the latter value can vary
# considerably with atmospheric conditions.  The general formula is # E = E0
# exp(-c X), where E0 is the value outside Earth's atmosphere, E is the value
# seen by an observer, X is the air mass and c is the extinction coefficient.
# A common value for c in reasonably clear air is 0.21, but values can be
# considerably greater in urban areas.  Apparent altitude is that perceived by
# an observer; it includes the effect of atmospheric refraction.  There is no
# shortage of formulas for air mass
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy)); all are subject to
# variations in local atmospheric conditions.  The formula used here is simple
# and is in good agreement with rigorously calculated values under standard
# conditions.
#
# Extraterrestrial illuminance or luminance of an object at a given altitude

# Visual magnitude of star or other celestial object.  The system of stellar
# magnitudes, developed in ancient Greece, assigned magnitudes from 1
# (brightest) to 6 (faintest visible to the naked eye).  In 1856, British
# astronomer Norman Pogson made the system precise, with a magnitude 1 object
# 100 times as bright as a magnitude 6 object, and each magnitude differing
# from the next by a constant ratio; the ratio, sometimes known as Pogson's
# ratio, is thus 100^0.2, or approximately 2.5119.  The logarithm of 100^0.2 is
# 0.4, hence the common use of powers of 10 and base-10 logarithms.

# Surface brightness of a celestial object of a given visual magnitude
# is a logarithmic measure of the luminance the object would have if its
# light were emitted by an object of specified solid angle; it is
# expressed in magnitudes per solid angle.  Surface brightness can be
# obtained from the visual magnitude by
#    S = m + 2.5 log(pi pi k a b),
# where k is the phase (fraction illuminated), a is the equatorial
# radius, and b is the polar radius.  For 100% illumination (e.g., full
# moon), this is often simplified to
#    S = m + 2.5 log(pi k s^2),
# where s is the object's angular semidiameter; the units of s determine
# the units of solid angle.  The visual magnitude and semidiameter must
# be appropriate for the object's distance; for other than 100%
# illumination, the visual magnitude must be appropriate for the phase.
# Luminance values are for outside Earth's atmosphere; they can be
# adjusted to terrestrial values by multiplying by one of the atm_transmission
# functions above.
