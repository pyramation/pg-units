# Temperature
#
# Two types of units are defined: units for converting temperature differences
# and functions for converting absolute temperatures.  Conversions for
# differences start with "deg" and conversions for absolute temperature start
# with "temp".

# In 1741 Anders Celsius introduced a temperature scale with water boiling at
# 0 degrees and freezing at 100 degrees at standard pressure. After his death
# the fixed points were reversed and the scale was called the centigrade
# scale.  Due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the temperature of
# melting ice at standard pressure, the centigrade scale was replaced in 1954
# by the Celsius scale which is defined by subtracting 273.15 from the
# temperature in Kelvins.  This definition differed slightly from the old
# centigrade definition, but the Kelvin scale depends on the triple point of
# water rather than a melting point, so it can be measured accurately.

# Fahrenheit defined his temperature scale by setting 0 to the coldest
# temperature he could produce in his lab with a salt water solution and by
# setting 96 degrees to body heat.  In Fahrenheit's words:
#
#    Placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea
#    salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which
#    is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same
#    mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A
#    third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer
#    is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy
#    man."  (D. G. Fahrenheit, Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)
