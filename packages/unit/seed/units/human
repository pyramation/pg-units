smoot              5 ft + 7 in # Created as part of an MIT fraternity prank.
                               #   In 1958 Oliver Smoot was used to measure
                               #   the length of the Harvard Bridge, which was
                               #   marked off in Smoot lengths.  These
                               #   markings have been maintained on the bridge
                               #   since then and repainted by subsequent
                               #   incoming fraternity members.  During a
                               #   bridge renovation the new sidewalk was
                               #   scored every Smoot rather than at the
                               #   customary 6 ft spacing.
