# The IP address space is divided into subnets.  The number of hosts
# in a subnet depends on the length of the subnet prefix.  This is
# often written as /N where N is the number of bits in the prefix.

# These definitions gives the number of hosts for a subnet whose
# prefix has the specified length in bits.
