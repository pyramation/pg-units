K_J90 483597.9 GHz/V    # Direct measurement of the volt is difficult.  Until
K_J   483597.8525 GHz/V #   recently, laboratories kept Weston cadmium cells as
                        #   a reference, but they could drift.  In 1987 the
                        #   CGPM officially recommended the use of the
                        #   Josephson effect as a laboratory representation of
                        #   the volt.  The Josephson effect occurs when two
                        #   superconductors are separated by a thin insulating
                        #   layer.  A "supercurrent" flows across the insulator
                        #   with a frequency that depends on the potential
                        #   applied across the superconductors.  This frequency
                        #   can be very accurately measured.  The Josephson
                        #   constant K_J, which is equal to 2e/h, relates the
                        #   measured frequency to the potential.  Two values
                        #   given, the conventional (exact) value from 1990 and
                        #   the current CODATA measured value.  
R_K90 25812.807 ohm     # Measurement of the ohm also presents difficulties.
R_K   25812.8074555 ohm #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances
                        #   that were subject to drift.  The new standard is
                        #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                        #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                        #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                        #   of the potential difference to the current is
                        #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                        #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                        #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very
                        #   large and the temperature very low.  This enables
                        #   accurate realization of the resistance h/e^2 in the
                        #   lab.  Two values given, the conventional (exact)
                        #   value from 1990 and the current CODATA measured
