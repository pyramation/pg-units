                              # it was legalized in 1707 by Queen Anne, and
                              # given the definition of 231 cubic inches.  It
                              # had been in use for a while as 8 pounds of wine
                              # using a merchant's pound, but the definition of
                              # the merchant's pound had become uncertain.  A
                              # pound of 15 tower ounces (6750 grains) had been
                              # common, but then a pound of 15 troy ounces
                              # (7200 grains) gained popularity.  Because of
                              # the switch in the value of the merchants pound,
                              # the size of the wine gallon was uncertain in
                              # the market, hence the official act in 1707.
                              # The act allowed that a six inch tall cylinder
                              # with a 7 inch diameter was a lawful wine
                              # gallon.  (This comes out to 230.9 in^3.)
                              # Note also that in Britain a legal conversion
                              # was established to the 1824 Imperial gallon
                              # then taken as 277.274 in^3 so that the wine
                              # gallon was 0.8331 imperial gallons.  This is
                              # 231.1 cubic inches (using the international
                              # inch).
