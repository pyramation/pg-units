# The length measure in the UK was defined by a bronze bar manufactured in
# 1844.  Various conversions were sanctioned for convenience at different
# times, which makes conversions before 1963 a confusing matter.  Apparently
# previous conversions were never explicitly revoked.  Four different
# conversion factors appear below.  Multiply them times an imperial length
# units as desired.  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 switched the UK away
# from their bronze standard and onto a definition of the yard in terms of the
# meter.  This happened after an international agreement in 1959 to align the
# world's measurement systems.
