# Photographic Exposure Value
# This section by Jeff Conrad (jeff_conrad@msn.com)
#
# The Additive system of Photographic EXposure (APEX) proposed in ASA
# PH2.5-1960 was an attempt to simplify exposure determination for people who
# relied on exposure tables rather than exposure meters.  Shortly thereafter,
# nearly all cameras incorporated exposure meters, so the APEX system never
# caught on, but the concept of exposure value remains in use.  Though given as
# 'Ev' in ASA PH2.5-1960, it is now more commonly indicated by 'EV'.  EV is
# related to exposure parameters by
#
#            A^2   LS   ES
#     2^EV = --- = -- = --
#             t    K    C
#
# Where
#     A = Relative aperture (f-number)
#     t = Exposure time in seconds
#     L = Scene luminance in cd/m2
#     E = Scene illuminance in lux
#     S = Arithmetic ISO speed
#     K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
#     C = Incident-light meter calibration constant
#
# Strictly, an exposure value is a combination of aperture and exposure time,
# but it's also commonly used to indicate luminance (or illuminance).
# Conversion to luminance or illuminance units depends on the ISO speed and the
# meter calibration constant.  Common practice is to use an ISO speed of 100.
# Calibration constants vary among camera and meter manufacturers: Canon,
# Nikon, and Sekonic use a value of 12.5 for reflected-light meters, while
# Kenko (formerly Minolta) and Pentax use a value of 14.  Kenko and Sekonic use
# a value of 250 for incident-light meters with flat receptors.
#
# The values for in-camera meters apply only averaging, weighted-averaging, or
# spot metering--the multi-segment metering incorporated in most current
# cameras uses proprietary algorithms that evaluate many factors related to the
# luminance distribution of what is being metered; they are not amenable to
# simple conversions, and are usually not disclosed by the manufacturers.

# Other Photographic Exposure Conversions
# 
# As part of APEX, ASA PH2.5-1960 proposed several logarithmic quantities
# related by
#
#    Ev = Av + Tv = Bv + Sv
#
# where
#  Av = log2(A^2)       Aperture value
#  Tv = log2(1/t)       Time value
#  Sv = log2(N Sx)      Speed value
#  Bv = log2(B S / K)   Luminance ("brightness") value
#  Iv = log2(I S / C)   Illuminance value
#
# and
#  A  = Relative aperture (f-number)
#  t  = Exposure time in seconds
#  Sx = Arithmetic ISO speed in 1/lux s
#  B  = luminance in cd/m2
#  I  = luminance in lux

# The constant N derives from the arcane relationship between arithmetic
# and logarithmic speed given in ASA PH2.5-1960.  That relationship
# apparently was not obvious--so much so that it was thought necessary
# to explain it in PH2.12-1961.  The constant has had several values
# over the years, usually without explanation for the changes.  Although
# APEX had little impact on consumer cameras, it has seen a partial
# resurrection in the Exif standards published by the Camera & Imaging
# Products Association of Japan.

# Units for Photographic Exposure Variables
#
# Practical photography sometimes pays scant attention to units for exposure
# variables.  In particular, the "speed" of the imaging medium is treated as if
# it were dimensionless when it should have units of reciprocal lux seconds;
# this practice works only because "speed" is almost invariably given in
# accordance with international standards (or similar ones used by camera
# manufacturers)--so the assumed units are invariant.  In calculating
# logarithmic quantities--especially the time value Tv and the exposure value
# EV--the units for exposure time ("shutter speed") are often ignored; this
# practice works only because the units of exposure time are assumed to be in
# seconds, and the missing units that make the argument to the logarithmic
# function dimensionless are silently provided.
#
# In keeping with common practice, the definitions that follow treat "speeds"
# as dimensionless, so ISO 100 speed is given simply as '100'.  When
# calculating the logarithmic APEX quantities Av and Tv, the definitions
# provide the missing units, so the times can be given with any appropriate
# units.  For example, giving an exposure time of 1 minute as either '1 min' or
# '60 s' will result in Tv of -5.9068906.
#
# Exposure Value from f-number and Exposure Time
# 
# Because nonlinear unit conversions only accept a single quantity,
# there is no direct conversion from f-number and exposure time to
# exposure value EV.  But the EV can be obtained from a combination of
# Av and Tv.  For example, the "sunny 16" rule states that correct
# exposure for a sunlit scene can achieved by using f/16 and an exposure
# time equal to the reciprocal of the ISO speed in seconds; this can be
# calculated as
#
#    ~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s),
#
# which gives 14.643856.  These conversions may be combined with the
# ev100 conversion:
#
#    ev100(~Av(16) + ~Tv(1|100 s))
#
# to yield the assumed average scene luminance of 3200 cd/m^2.
