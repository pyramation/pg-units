# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.
