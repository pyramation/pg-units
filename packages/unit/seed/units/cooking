# Density measures.  Density has traditionally been measured on a variety of
# bizarre nonlinear scales.
#

# Density of a sugar syrup is frequently measured in candy making procedures.
# In the USA the boiling point of the syrup is measured.  Some recipes instead
# specify the density using degrees Baume.  Conversion between degrees Baume
# and the boiling point measure has proved elusive.  This table appeared in one
# text, and provides a fragmentary relationship to the concentration.

# Degrees brix measures sugar concentration by weigh as a percentage, so a

# density figure for water given in the same NIST reference.  They use the
