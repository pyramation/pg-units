# The metric paper sizes are defined so that if a sheet is cut in half
# along the short direction, the result is two sheets which are
# similar to the original sheet.  This means that for any metric size,
# the long side is close to sqrt(2) times the length of the short
# side.  Each series of sizes is generated by repeated cuts in half,
# with the values rounded down to the nearest millimeter.

# gsm (Grams per Square Meter), a sane, metric paper weight measure

gsm                     grams / meter^2

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# When paper is marked in units of M, it means the weight of 1000 sheets of the

# the paper in question.

# In addition paper weight is reported in "caliper" which is simply the
# thickness of one sheet, typically in inches.  Thickness is also reported in
# "points" where a point is 1|1000 inch.  These conversions are supplied to
# convert these units roughly (using an approximate density) into the standard
# paper weight values.
