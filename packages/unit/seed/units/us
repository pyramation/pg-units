# The US Metric Law of 1866 legalized the metric system in the USA and
# defined the meter in terms of the British system with the exact
# 1 meter = 39.37 inches.  On April 5, 1893 Thomas Corwin Mendenhall,
# Superintendent of Weights and Measures, decided, in what has become
# known as the "Mendenhall Order" that the meter and kilogram would be the
# fundamental standards in the USA.  The definition from 1866 was turned
# around to give an exact definition of the yard as 3600|3937 meters This
# definition was used until July of 1959 when the definition was changed
# to bring the US and other English-speaking countries into agreement; the
# Canadian value of 1 yard = 0.9144 meter (exactly) was chosen because it
# was approximately halfway between the British and US values; it had the
# added advantage of making 1 inch = 25.4 mm (exactly).  Since 1959, the
# "international" foot has been exactly 0.3048 meters.  At the same time,
# it was decided that any data expressed in feet derived from geodetic
# surveys within the US would continue to use the old definition and call
# the old unit the "survey foot." The US continues to define the statute
# mile, furlong, chain, rod, link, and fathom in terms of the US survey
# foot.

# with the definition of the meter in the metric joint resolution of

wineglass               150 mL     # the size of a "typical" serving

# A unit of alcohol is a specified mass of pure ethyl alcohol.
# The term is used officially in the UK, but other countries use the same
# concept but with different values.  For example, the UK value of 8 g is
# nominally the amount of alcohol that a typical adult can metabolize in
# one hour.  Values for several countries, converted to a volumetric basis:

alcoholunitus           14 g   / ethanoldensity
alcoholunitca           13.6 g / ethanoldensity
alcoholunituk            8 g   / ethanoldensity
alcoholunitau           10 g   / ethanoldensity

# Example: for 12% ABV (alcohol by volume)
# alcoholunitus / 12% = 147.8 mL, close to the “standard” serving of 150 mL.

# USA shoe sizes.  These express the length of the shoe or the length
# of the "last", the form that the shoe is made on.  But note that
# this only captures the length.  It appears that widths change 1/4
# inch for each letter within the same size, and if you change the
# length by half a size then the width changes between 1/8 inch and
# 1/4 inch.  But this may not be standard.  If you know better, please
