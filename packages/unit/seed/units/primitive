# The radian and steradian are defined as dimensionless primitive units.
# The radian is equal to m/m and the steradian to m^2/m^2 so these units are
# dimensionless.  Retaining them as named units is useful because it allows
# clarity in expressions and makes the meaning of unit definitions more clear.
# These units will reduce to 1 in conversions but not for sums of units or for
# arguments to functions.
