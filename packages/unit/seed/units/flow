# Miner's inch:  This is an old historic unit used in the Western  United
# States.  It is generally defined as the rate of flow through a one square
# inch hole at a specified depth such as 4 inches.  In the late 19th century,
# volume of water was sometimes measured in the "24 hour inch".  Values for the
# miner's inch were fixed by state statues.  (This information is from a web
# site operated by the Nevada Division of Water Planning:  The Water Words
# Dictionary at http://www.state.nv.us/cnr/ndwp/dict-1/waterwds.htm.)

# Oceanographic flow

sverdrup                1e6 m^3 / sec   # Used to express flow of ocean
                                        # currents.  Named after Norwegian

# In vacuum science and some other applications, gas flow is measured
# as the product of volumetric flow and pressure.  This is useful
# because it makes it easy to compare with the flow at standard
# pressure (one atmosphere).  It also directly relates to the number
# of gas molecules per unit time, and hence to the mass flow if the
# molecular mass is known.

# A polytropic process is one for which PV^k = const, where P is the
# pressure, V is the volume, and k is the polytropic exponent.  The
# polytropic index is n = 1 / (k - 1).  As noted in the Wikipedia article

# Gauge pressure functions
#
# Gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric pressure.  In the English
# system, where pressure is often given in pounds per square inch, gauge
# pressure is often indicated by 'psig' to distinguish it from absolute
# pressure, often indicated by 'psia'.  At the standard atmospheric pressure
# of 14.696 psia, a gauge pressure of 0 psig is an absolute pressure of 14.696
# psia; an automobile tire inflated to 31 psig has an absolute pressure of
# 45.696 psia.
#
# With gaugepressure(), the units must be specified (e.g., gaugepressure(1.5
# bar)); with psig(), the units are taken as psi, so the example above of tire
# pressure could be given as psig(31).
#
# If the normal elevation is significantly different from sea level, change
# Patm appropriately, and adjust the lower domain limit on the gaugepressure
# definition.
