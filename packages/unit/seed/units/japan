# Traditional Japanese units (shakkanhou)
#
# The traditional system of weights and measures is called shakkanhou from the
# shaku and the ken.  Japan accepted SI units in 1891 and legalized conversions
# to the traditional system.  In 1909 the inch-pound system was also legalized,
# so Japan had three legally approved systems.  A change to the metric system
# started in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance.  The Measurement Law of
# October 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units.  However, the old
# units still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books
# and tools used for handicrafts.
#
# Note that units below use the Hepburn romanization system.  Some other
# systems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".

# Japanese Proportions.  These are still in everyday use.  They also
# get used as units to represent the proportion of the standard unit.

bu_proportion        1|100    # The character bu can also be read fun or bun
                              # but usually "bu" is used for units.

# Japanese Length Measures
#
# The length system is called kanejaku or
# square and originated in China.  It was
# adopted as Japan's official measure in 701
# by the Taiho Code.  This system is still in
# common use in architecture and clothing.

# Japanese architecture is based on a "standard" size of tatami mat.
# Room sizes today are given in number of tatami, and this number
# determines the spacing between colums and hence sizes of sliding
# doors and paper screens.  However, every region has its own slightly
# different tatami size.  Edoma, used in and around Tokyo and
# Hokkaido, is becoming a nationwide standard.  Kyouma is used around
# Kyoto, Osaka and Kyuushu, and Chuukyouma is used around Nagoya.
# Note that the tatami all have the aspect ratio 2:1 so that the mats
# can tile the room with some of them turned 90 degrees.
